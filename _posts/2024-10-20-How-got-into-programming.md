It was september 2017 when I got admission into a technical university in Ghana here to study Computer Science. This was great news for me looking at the circumstance I was in then, I had stayed home for three years after completing my senior high school education and prior to gaining admission I was going through some personal issues.

My bosses then were very happy when I broke the news to them I wanted to further my schooling and I must confess they were very helpful when I got admission. I went to level 100 not knowing much about computers the only skill I had was using Microsoft word and the basics of Excel and a little knowledge on Corel Draw. I had knowledge on these tools because I was lucky I will say. During my first year semester in school I got introduced to programming in C++ this time I didn't take programming very seriously because I just wanted to learn and pass by exams which is what most friends did. To be honest I tried my best and my second semester too was okay.

My brains shifted to take programming serious when I did my internship at a second referal hospital in my community, I did that internship because it was mandatory to do internship after every second semester. During this time I had wonderful boss who was a nigerian and he introduced me python programming I had heared so much about it but I wasn't interest my goal was to pass my exams. I can remember my first day of internship he asked "What programming language do you know?" and my response was "c++" and that was because of the intro to programming with c++ I studied in my first year. I owe him alot of gratitude for an eye opener on the endless posiblities of computer programming.

He gave me ebooks on python programming to read them and also introduced me to Django one popular python framework for web development. It was then that I took programming seriously and propelled to becoming one of the best student in my class when it comes to programming. Academic work on programming was really easy for me but real life's developement which is building projects was a big headache. Though I completed schooling with flying colours I still couldn't really develop anything substantial. I was obsessed with programming in october,2021 after my national service.

Since October 2021 I had been learning the basics of all popular programming language around, I have experience tutorial hell for a very long time but as on this writing I'm out of that and have built a few website here and there. I am learning all the time to improve my self, though I get distraction most the time I am working on it. My aim is to build something that would be used my a million people and I don't know if I would ever achieve that but I am working on it. Today I build web application with Javascript and I am learn [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
